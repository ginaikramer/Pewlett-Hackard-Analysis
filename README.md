# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to help Pewlett-Hackard prepare for the possiblility of a wave of retirements, called the "silver tsunami". This analysis:
- Helps determine the number of retiring employees by their title
- Identifies employees who are eligibile to participate in a mentorship program 

The following file was used in building this report: [PyBer Data Analysis](/PyBer_Challenge.ipynb) 

## Results
This project produced the following two analysis deliverables:
1) [Retiring Titles](/Data/retiring_titles.csv): Summarizes the total number of employees, of retirement age, by title. 
   
2) [Mentorship Eligibility](/Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv): Contains a list of employees, born between January 1 and December 31, 1965, who are eligibile for Pewlett-Hackard's mentorship program.

The takeaway from these two deliverables include four major points:
- The total number of possible retirees is 90,398 employees. These are employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. 
- ![Retiring Tiles Summary](/Data/retiring_titles.png)  
- 90,398 possible retirees make up a lttle under 1/3 of Hewlett-Packard's current workforce, which has 300,024 employees total.
  - Reference [Hewlett Packard's Current Employee List](/Data/employees.csv)
- The number of senior engineers and senior staff employees who are of retirement age, are both more than double the amount of engineers and staff.
- ![Retiring Tiles Observation](/Data/retiring_titles_double.png) 
- There are 1549 employees eligible for Hewlett Packard's mentorship program
- ![Mentorship Eligible](/Data/mentorship_rows.png)  

## Summary
In summary, this outcome of this analysis provides answers to the following questions:

1) How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Hewlett-Packard needs to fill more than 90,000 positions to reduce the impact of the 'silver tsunami'. 

2) Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
While there are 1549 retirement-ready employees eligibile by age for the mentorship program, several hundred of them aren't in senior positions themselves. This creates an additional challenge to Hewlett-Packard to first help several hundred retirement-ready employees become qualified enough to help the next generation of employees.

In addition, the follow queries and output provide even more insight:
